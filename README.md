# Applied Modeling: Dangerous Asteroids

Notebook-based explorations of a greatly imbalanced dataset and high-precision model tuning.

Of the tens of thousands of detected sub-planetary objects in our solar system, very few have attributes that make them a potential threat to Earth. On the other hand, just one can disrupt life on Earth for millions of years, so we need to be very, very precise in how we deal with Near-Earth Object data. In this project I explore various methods for boosting the accuracy of predictive models via model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and input resampling, with a goal or reproducing the results of the NASA classification at various levels of data parity.
